    "The National Hockey League (NHL) operates under a salary cap system, which limits the amount of money that each team can spend on player contracts. Here's how it works:\nDetermining the Cap Ceiling: The NHL sets a ceiling for the total amount of money that all teams are allowed to spend on player contracts for each season. This number is based on revenue generated by the league through television deals, sponsorships, and ticket sales.\nCalculating Each Team's Cap Space: Each team's cap space is calculated by subtracting the amount of money they have committed to players already under contract from their cap ceiling. For example, if a team has $80 million committed to existing contracts and the cap ceiling is $75 million, then the team would have $3 million in cap space ($75 million - $80 million).\nSigning Players: When a team signs a new player or extends an existing one, the contract counts towards the team's cap space. If a team exceeds its cap space, it must either trade away salary or demote players to the minor leagues to get back under the cap limit.\nExceptions: There are several exceptions to the cap rule that allow teams to sign players without counting them against their cap space. These include:\nEntry-level contracts: Rookies who have not yet played in the NHL can be signed to entry-level contracts with no cap hit.\nQualifying offers: Teams can make qualifying offers to restricted free agents to retain their rights.
